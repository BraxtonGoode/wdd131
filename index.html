                <p>
                    My name is Braxton Goode and I was Born in Mesa, Arizona and now live in Tucson, Tucson. 
                    I am an only child too two loving parents. I am currently going to school to earn a 
                    bachelors degree in Software Development. I have been in the BYU pathway program for the last 
                    2 years. Once i finish my schooling through this program i hope to be able to work in the fields of 
                    game design and or  in backend development. Some things that i enjoy doing are reading, playing
                     games and spending time with family.
